<p>Baseball is a month into a season that many thought might not be played. In December, <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Collective_bargaining_agreement#:~:text=The%20Collective%20Bargaining%20Agreement%20(CBA,Association%20web%20site%20%5B1%5D.">the collective bargaining agreement</a> between Major League Baseball and its players' union expired. At the time, baseball feared the worst: an eventual dealy of the season, causing the ever-dwindling supporters of the league to grow disgruntled. According to a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/lat-mlb-lockout/">poll</a> from the Los Angeles Times and SurveyMonkey fielded in early March, this fear was warranted. Six in 10 Major League Baseball fans say the players-owners dispute has made them lose interest in this year's baseball season. John Wolohan, professor of Sports Law in the David B. Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics at Syracuse University, is an MLB legal expert. He predicted the legal battle between players and owners would lead to this apathy. </p>

<p>In the ten years before the crowd-free COVID season, Major League Baseball ballpark attendance declined. From 2009 to 2019, attendance fell by more than seven percent, according to baseball-reference. </p>

<p>Dr. Jeremy Losak is an assistant professor also in the Falk School. He says the constantly declining attendance scares executives and others involved in the game. He says teams are focusing on expanding in-game experiences for fans to spend more money while they’re in the stadium. The decline in attendance has been more than made up for by the increase in overall cost for a day at the ballpark, more than 28% from 2009 to 2019. </p>

<p>The Team Marketing Report releases an annual “MLB Fan Cost Index,” which measures the price of attending a game, considering factors like the price of tickets, food, and beer. There are significant disparities across the league looking at the cost of beer. Some stadiums, like Denver and Pheonix, sell brews for less than five bucks, while the Mets, Phillies, and Nationals are cracking the $10 mark. </p>

<h3>Beers $5 or under </h3>
<ul>
  <body><li>Colorado Rockies (Coors Field): $3</li>
  <li>Arizona Diamondbacks (Chase Field): $4</li>
  <li>Atlanta Braves (Truist Park): $5</li>
  <li>Detroit Tigers (Comerica Park): $5 </li>
  <li>Los Angeles Angels (Angel Stadium of Anaheim): $5</li>
  <li>Miami Marlins (LoanDepot Park): $5</li>
  <li>San Diego Padres (Petco Park): $5</li>
  <li>Seattle Mariners (T-Mobile Park): $5</li>
  <li>St. Louis Cardinals (Busch Stadium): $5</li>
  <li>Tampa Bay Rays (Tropicana Field): $5 </li></body>
 
 

<p>Why are some ballparks so much cheaper than others? Many factors play into the price of concessions at stadiums. For one, the stadiums with stadium sponsors of beer companies (i.e., Coors Field in Denver and Bush Stadium in St. Louis) are bound to have some of the cheapest beer. Then, on the other hand, teams that play in cities with high per capita incomes know they can charge more like New York City and Washington D.C. </p>

<p>It has been a long-held American tradition, regardless of how romanticized or untrue, that a sacred moment is a parent bringing the next generation of baseball fans to their first ballgame to experience America’s pastime. The only problem: fans are getting priced out of that sacred custom. Jeremy Losak was not surprised at all by the sizable increase in cost. He says one thing sports teams have done to compensate for declining attendance across sports is highlight premium revenue sources, luxury services, suits, and more high-end options. This trend has jacked up the price for all fans: again leading to an average of more than a 28 percent overall increase in the cost of attending games. So where can you find the cheapest ticket? </p>

<p>After compiling all the data, the data showed all 30 teams ranked by the total cost of attending a game; however, this doesn’t necessarily show which stadium is the cheapest. The most expensive tickets may be in New York or San Francisco, but the actual price isn't as much because the average person makes more money in those places. The same is true for the opposite of this. With this in mind, I took the per capita income of each city, divided by the average number of hours worked by Americans per year to find the average hourly wage of each team’s city. I then split the total cost of attending a game with a family of four by the average hourly wage to demonstrate which cities would require the most and least amount of hours worked to attend a game. </p>

<iframe title="Hours of work needed for family of four to attend game" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-kSWEv" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kSWEv/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="305"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

<p>Looking at the lowest price to attend a game is a little misleading. The Arizona Diamondbacks are, in theory, the cheapest games to go to; however, after considering how much people make in Pheonix, it falls to the fifth most affordable. The same is true in the opposite direction: the San Francisco Giants, in the top ten most expensive, are eighth-most affordable after factoring in per capita income. What’s the most and least amount of hours needed to work to experience America’s past time with the family, you might be asking? The Atlanta Braves top the list of most affordable, needing a mear 5.64 hours of work. The Detroit Tigers come in dead last, requiring the motor city faithful to work an average of 14.28 hours to see their big cats. </p>

<p>Like any data set, it comes with a grain of salt. Despite deriving all my per capita income data from the US census bureau, some outliers distort the result (i.e., Detroit has the lowest per capita income of only $19,569). There are also era-specific things that cause the same thing. For example, the 2009 season was the first year new Yankees Stadium opened. Meaning the price of attending a game was far greater due to the sheer demand. </p>
